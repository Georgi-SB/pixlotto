menu1_text = <p>What is luck? It is hard to put it in words let alone describe it with numbers. Is 3, 5,22, 36, 39, 47 luckier than 8,19,24,28,34,49?  But yes we humans do think and feel in terms of pictures, in terms of views. That motivated us to extract numbers from our visions of luck!</p><p>The classical view is that the world exists in its deterministically unique objective state and by observing it we are merely registering its state, the so called "reality".</p><p>The quantum mechanics however shows us a very different picture, at least on the micro level:  the world is a “bag of possibilities” and by observing it we are actually drawing one of these possibilities and fixing it as our current “reality”. This view is conceptually different from the classical one in that we as observers are actually actively playing an important role in creating our reality. In some metaphorical sense it is a common sense that actually we do,  but the modern quantum mechanics is very explicit that it is true even in the very plain sense of these words:  *just by observing some phenomenon we are actively fixing its outcome*.  Our reality is then not anymore completely objective as we are actively participating in its creation.  It is as a strange view as to make  one of the most famous physicists and Nobel prize winner Richard Feynman say “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics*.*”  Still, in our humble point of view these effects among others are very well explained in the great book and movie “What the bleep do we know” <a href="http://www.whatthebleep.com/">http://www.whatthebleep.com/</a> and we strongly encourage you to dig deeper in this interesting matter.</p><p>The quantum mechanical view is certainly true on the micro level – nowadays science is very explicit with this respect- and it would be very odd indeed if our macro world would be conceptually different.  We are indeed made of all these quantum particles and for example the neurons in our brains are small enough to show quantum effects on a well measurable scale in line with our nowadays understanding.</p><p>But if we are really recreating our world even by simply observing it, it is obviously incredibly important what state of mind we are in while doing so. In particular how do we feel about the different possibilities.</p><p>Back to the lotto numbers, we all know that humans (even mathematicians) tend to think, feel and dream in pictures, not really in words and certainly not in numbers.  Therefore we found a way to translate a picture into numbers so you can create your own lucky lotto numbers from pictures you feel strong about. This can help you link the state of mind triggered by the picture with the generated lotto numbers and observe the lotto draws accordingly.</p><p>Does it help?  There are a lot of visualization techniques in other areas and they do claim it works. They have existed in the past and are still here now. In our point of view   they are too numerous and persistent to be dismissed as complete nonsense. People say “where there's smoke, there's fire”.   After all, classically or quantum mechanically it is all up to you!  And remember - take care what you wish for as it will eventually come true.</p><br>Go and get lucky!
