slogan = We are all up to get lucky
top_text = You know how there are special people or things in your life that just make you feel fortunate? Or you have a dream you aspire towards? Yet defining luck with words is tricky, let alone pick lucky numbers. We humans do tend to think, hope, dream and envision in pictures. Let us translate your pictures in lotto numbers.

menu1_text = <p>What is luck? It is hard to put it in words let alone describe it with numbers. Is 3, 5,22, 36, 39, 47 luckier than 8,19,24,28,34,49?  \
But yes we humans do think and feel in terms of pictures, in terms of views. That motivated us to extract numbers from our visions of luck!</p> \
<p>The classical view is that the world exists in its deterministically unique objective state and by observing it we are merely registering its state, \
the so called "reality".</p><p>The quantum mechanics however shows us a very different picture, at least on the micro level:  the world is a "bag of possibilities" \
and by observing it we are actually drawing one of these possibilities and fixing it as our current "reality". This view is conceptually different from the classical \
one in that we as observers are actually actively playing an important role in creating our reality. In some metaphorical sense it is a common sense that actually we do, \
 but the modern quantum mechanics is very explicit that it is true even in the very plain sense of these words:  *just by observing some phenomenon we are actively fixing \
 its outcome*.  Our reality is then not anymore completely objective as we are actively participating in its creation.  It is as a strange view as to make  one of the most  \
 famous physicists and Nobel prize winner Richard Feynman say "I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics*.*"  Still, in our humble point of view  \
 these effects among others are very well explained in the great book and movie "What the bleep do we know" <a href="http://www.whatthebleep.com/">http://www.whatthebleep.com/</a>  \
 and we strongly encourage you to dig deeper in this interesting matter.</p><p>The quantum mechanical view is certainly true on the micro level - nowadays science is very explicit  \
 with this respect - and it would be very odd indeed if our macro world would be conceptually different.  We are indeed made of all these quantum particles and for example the  \
 neurons in our brains are small enough to show quantum effects on a well measurable scale in line with our nowadays understanding.</p><p>But if we are really recreating our  \
 world even by simply observing it, it is obviously incredibly important what state of mind we are in while doing so. In particular how do we feel about the different possibilities.</p> \
 <p>Back to the lotto numbers, we all know that humans (even mathematicians) tend to think, feel and dream in pictures, not really in words and certainly not in numbers.  \
 Therefore we found a way to translate a picture into numbers so you can create your own lucky lotto numbers from pictures you feel strong about. This can help you link the state \
 of mind triggered by the picture with the generated lotto numbers and observe the lotto draws accordingly.</p><p>Does it help?  There are a lot of visualization techniques in  \
 other areas and they do claim it works. They have existed in the past and are still here now. In our point of view   they are too numerous and persistent to be dismissed as  \
 complete nonsense. People say "where there's smoke, there's fire".   After all, classically or quantum mechanically it is all up to you!  And remember - take care what you wish  \
 for as it will eventually come true.</p> \
 <br>Go and get lucky!
menu2_text = <p>Once called Terra Australis Incognita, the unknown land of the south, Australia is \
for good not that unknown any more. Beautiful beaches, excellent climate, \
open minded relaxed people with a fun laid back attitude, great cities, unique marvelous nature, clean oceans \
and air ... well lets stop here even if we could keep on listing reasons \
why you should love this place. </p> \
 <p> The experts are on the same opinion and there is no wonder why cities like \
Sydney and Melbourne occupy the first places on various lists of the most \
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_most_livable_cities">liveable cities</a>  in the world. </p> \
 <p> We can give you just one more item on that list - there is a great  choice \
of excellent lotto games down under and  you don't have to be an Australian \
resident to play them. You can do \
so comfortably on-line via the exclusive internet distributor \
 <a href="http://www.ozlotteries.com/">ozlotteries.com</a> of the most popular games in the country. \
You can pay with paypal, credit card or bank transfer and collect your \
proceeds via (international) bank transfer as well.</p> \
<p> The range of the offered games is broad but the most popular by a large \
margin are the   <a href="http://www.ozlotteries.com/play/saturday-lotto">Lotto</a>, \
<a href="http://www.ozlotteries.com/play/oz-lotto">OzLotto</a>    and \
<a href="http://www.ozlotteries.com/play/powerball">PowerBall</a>. \
In Lotto you choose 6 numbers out of 45 which makes the chances to win \
considerably higher compared to the Euro Millions for example. On the \
downside, this makes the proceeds  comparatively lower but still typically larger than 1 million Australlian \
Dollars. But, hey, you can \
buy a double bedroom semi or even a house for well below a million \
AUD  close to one of the most beautiful beaches in the \
world. \
Investing enough in a property in Australia can earn you a permanent \
residency status which, given the excellent health care, social security \
and schooling together with the obvious \
reasons listed above, is not to be underestimated at all. </p> \
 <p> If you want to go for the large jackpots then the <a href="http://www.ozlotteries.com/play/oz-lotto">OzLotto</a> \
  and the \
<a href="http://www.ozlotteries.com/play/powerball">PowerBall</a> \
 are the games to play. In OzLotto you choose 7 out of 45 \
numbers while in PowerBall \
you pick 6 out of 40 and a one powerball from 20.  The jackpots in these \
games are well into the two digit million range. </p> \
 <p>Again, you can play them all  on \
<a href="http://www.ozlotteries.com/">ozlotteries.com</a>   which is the exlusive \
internet distributor  for these games.  </p> \
 <br> \
Enjoy and good luck, mate!
